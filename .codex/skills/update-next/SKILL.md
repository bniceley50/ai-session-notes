# update-next

# # When to use
Use when NEXT.md is messy, outdated, or not actionable.

# # Workflow
1) Read `NEXT.md` plus any recent JOURNAL notes that imply priorities.
2) Rewrite NEXT into:
   - Now (today/next 1–2 hours)
   - Next (this week)
   - Later (parking lot)
3) Each task should be verb-first and include a verify line when applicable.
4) Run `tools\gate.cmd`

# # Output format
- Proposed rewritten NEXT.md
- Assumptions made
